### New site requests:
1. Visit an article on the site you want to bypass the paywall for and copy the article title.
2. Open up a new Private window (Ctrl+Shift+P) and paste the article title into Google.
3. Click on the same article from the Google search results page. If it loads without a paywall you can [submit a request](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-firefox/issues/new) to add the site, otherwise my extension cannot bypass it either.

### Troubleshooting
* This add-on works best along with [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
* For The Denver Post turn off uBlock.
* If a site doesn't work try turning off uBlock and refreshing.
